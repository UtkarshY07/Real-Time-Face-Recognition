# Real-Time-Face-Recognition

## Pre-requisites <br/>
OpenCV installed (see the previous blog post for details) <br/>
A working webcam<br/> <br/>

## To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases: <br/>
* Face Detection and Data Gathering  <br/>
* Train the Recognizer  <br/>
* Face Recognition <br/> <br/>
